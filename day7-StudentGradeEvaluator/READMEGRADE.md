# 📚 Day 7 - Student Grade Evaluator (Java Console App)

This is a beginner-friendly Java console application that simulates a **student grade evaluator**. The program collects a student's name and their grades in Math, Physics, and Chemistry. It calculates the average and determines both the **pass/fail status** and a **grade letter (A–F)** with personalized feedback.

## 👨‍💻 What This App Does:

- 🧠 Accepts input for:
  - Student's name
  - Math grade
  - Physics grade
  - Chemistry grade
- 🧮 Calculates the average
- ✅ Checks if the student **passed or failed** (threshold = 50)
- 🎯 Assigns a **grade letter** (A, B, C, D, F)
- 💬 Prints **custom messages** using `switch` based on the grade
